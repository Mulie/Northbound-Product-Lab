Tech stack: ImprovMX (email forwarding) + Gmail (send-as)

What you need 
A domain you own
Access to your domain’s DNS settings
A Gmail account

Step 1 — Set up free email forwarding (ImprovMX)
Go to improvmx.com

Click Add domain
Enter your domain (example: yourdomain.com)

Create a forwarding rule:
Alias: hello (or your name)

Destination: yourgmail@gmail.com

Result:
hello@yourdomain.com → yourgmail@gmail.com


Step 2 — Add MX records to your domain (critical)
Go to your domain’s DNS manager and add both MX records below.

Type
Host
Value
Priority
MX
@
mx1.improvmx.com
10
MX
@
mx2.improvmx.com
20

Save changes.

⏳ DNS propagation usually takes 5–60 minutes (sometimes longer).

Step 3 — Add SPF record (avoid spam)
Still in DNS, add this TXT record:
Type
Host
Value
TXT
@
v=spf1 include:improvmx.com ~all

⚠️ If an SPF record already exists, edit it and add include:improvmx.com — do not create a second SPF record.


Step 4 — Test receiving email
Send a test email from another account to:
hello@yourdomain.com

If it arrives in Gmail, forwarding is working ✅

Step 5 — Configure Gmail to send FROM your domain
Open Gmail
Go to Settings → See all settings

Open Accounts and Import

Under Send mail as, click Add another email address
Enter:
Name: Your name
Email: hello@yourdomain.com

Check Treat as an alias
SMTP settings
SMTP server: smtp.gmail.com
Username: yourgmail@gmail.com

Password: Gmail App Password (next step)
Port: 587
TLS: ON

Step 6 — Create a Gmail App Password (required)

Go to Google Account → Security

Enable 2-Step Verification

Open App Passwords

Create a password for Mail

Use this password in Step 5

Step 7 — Set your default From address
In Gmail:
Go to Accounts and Import
Under Send mail as
Set hello@yourdomain.com as default

Final result
Every email you send:
Comes from your domain
Uses Gmail’s interface
Costs nothing

Troubleshooting quick checks
Only two MX records should exist (ImprovMX)
Only one SPF record should exist
DNS changes may take up to 4 hours on some hosts

This setup is ideal for founders, consultants, and solo operators who want a professional email without paying for Google Workspace.
